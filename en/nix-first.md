# First steps with Nix

You have [[install|installed Nix]]. Now let's play with the `nix` command but without bothering to write any Nix expressions yet (we reserve that for the [[nix-rapid|next tutorial]]). In particular, we will learn how to use packages from the [[nixpkgs|nixpkgs]] repository and elsewhere.

![[nix-first.png]]

{#run}
## Running a package

As of this writing, [[nixpkgs]] has over 80,000 packages. You can search them [here](https://search.nixos.org/packages). Search for "`cowsay`" and [you will find](https://search.nixos.org/packages?type=packages&query=cowsay) that it is available in Nixpkgs. We can download and run the [cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) package as follows:

```text
$ nix run nixpkgs#cowsay "G'day $USER"
 ____________
< G'day srid >
 ------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     || 
$
```

>[!info] `nix run`
> `nix run` command will run the specified package from the flake. Here `nixpkgs` is the [[flakes|flake]], followed by the letter `#`, which is followed by the package ([[drv]]) name `cowsay` that is outputted by that flake. See [[flake-url]] for details on the syntax.

{#inside-package}
## Looking inside a package

What is a Nix "package"? Technically, a Nix package is a special [[store-path]] built using instructions from a [[drv]], both of which reside in the [[store]]. To see what is contained by the `cowsay` package, look inside its [[store-path]]. To get the store path for a package (here, `cowsay`), run `nix build` as follows:

```text
$ nix build nixpkgs#cowsay --no-link --print-out-paths
/nix/store/8ij2wj5nh4faqwqjy1fqg20llawbi0d5-cowsay-3.7.0-man
/nix/store/n1lnrvgl43k6zln1s5wxcp2zh9bm0z63-cowsay-3.7.0
```

The `cowsay` [[drv]] produces two output paths, the second of which is the cowsay binary package (the first one is the separate documentation path), and if you inspect that[^tree] you will see the contents of it:

[^tree]: Incidentally, we use the [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_\(command\)) command, rather than `ls`, to look at the directory tree, using the package from [[nixpkgs]] of course (since it may not already be installed).

```text
$ nix run nixpkgs#tree /nix/store/n1lnrvgl43k6zln1s5wxcp2zh9bm0z63-cowsay-3.7.0
/nix/store/n1lnrvgl43k6zln1s5wxcp2zh9bm0z63-cowsay-3.7.0
├── bin
│   ├── cowsay
│   └── cowthink -> cowsay
└── share
    └── cowsay
        ├── cows
        │   ├── DragonAndCow.pm
        │   ├── Example.pm
        │   ├── Frogs.pm
        │   ├── ...
```

>[!info] Nix Store & Store Paths
> `/nix/store` is a special directory representing the [[store]]. The paths inside `/nix/store` are known as [[store-path]]. Nix fundamentally is, in large part, about manipulating these store paths in a *pure* and *reproducible* fashion; [[drv]] are "recipes" that does this manipulation, and they too live in the [[store]].

{#shell}
## Shell environment

One of the powers of Nix is that it enables us to create *isolated* [[shell|shell]] environments containing just the packages we need. For eg., here's how we create a transient shell containing the "cowsay" and "[fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix))" packages:

```text
$ nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay nixpkgs#fortune 
❯
```

From here, you can verify that both the programs are indeed in `$PATH` as indicated by the "bin" directory in their respective [[store-path|store paths]]:

```text
$ nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay nixpkgs#fortune 
❯ which cowsay
/nix/store/n1lnrvgl43k6zln1s5wxcp2zh9bm0z63-cowsay-3.7.0/bin/cowsay
❯ which fortune
/nix/store/mfw77f008xy0zb7dqdyggw0xj2gd4jjv-fortune-mod-3.20.0/bin/fortune
❯ fortune | cowsay

                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

>[!tip] One-off command
> Instead of creating a shell environment, you can also run commands one-off using the `-c` option. The above session can equally be achieved using: 
> ```text
> nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay nixpkgs#fortune -c sh -c 'fortune | cowsay'
> ```

{#install}
## Installing a package

>[!warning] Declarative package management
> This section explains how to install a package *imperatively*. For a better way of installing packages (*declaratively*), see [[hm-tutorial|home-manager]].

Neither `nix run` nor `nix shell` will mutate your system environment, aside from changing the [[store]]. If you would like to *permanently* install a package somewhere under your $HOME directory, you can do so using `nix profile install`:

```text
$ nix profile install nixpkgs#cowsay nixpkgs#fortune
$ which cowsay
/home/user/.nix-profile/bin/cowsay
$ which fortune
/home/user/.nix-profile/bin/fortune
$ 
```

`nix profile install` installs symlinks under the `$HOME/.nix-profile` directory, which the Nix [[install|installer]] already added to your `$PATH`. For details, see the [Nix manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-profile-install).

These symlinks, ultimately, point to the package [[store-path]] outputs under the [[store]], viz.:

```text
$ readlink $(which fortune)
/nix/store/mfw77f008xy0zb7dqdyggw0xj2gd4jjv-fortune-mod-3.20.0/bin/fortune
```

Note that this is the same path used by both `nix build` and `nix shell`. Each specific package is uniquely identified by their [[store-path]]; changing any part of its [[drv|build recipe]] (including dependencies), changes that path. Hence, nix is reproducible.

{#nixpkgs-pin}
## How is [[nixpkgs]] fetched

So far we have been retrieving and installing software from the [[nixpkgs]] flake, which is defined in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs. This information comes from the [[registry]]:


```text
$ nix registry list | grep nixpkgs
global flake:nixpkgs github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable
```

A registry is simply a mapping of flake alias to [[flake-url]].

>[!tip] Adding to registry
> You can add your own flakes to this [[registry|registry]] as well. See [the manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-registry-add)

We can find the current Git revision of [[nixpkgs]] used by our [[registry|registry]] as follows:

```text
❯ nix flake metadata nixpkgs --json | nix run nixpkgs#jq -- -r .locked.rev
317484b1ead87b9c1b8ac5261a8d2dd748a0492d
```

From here, you can see the revision [on GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/317484b1ead87b9c1b8ac5261a8d2dd748a0492d).

The discerning readers may have noticed that the registry specifies *only* the branch (`nixpkgs-unstable`), but not the specific revision. Nix registry internally [caches flakes locally and updates them automatically](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-registry#description), thus the specific Git revision of [[nixpkgs]] used may change over time!

> [!tip] Pinning nixpkgs
> To avoid the aforementioned automatic update, you can manually [pin](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-registry-pin) the registry entry for [[nixpkgs]]. In [[hm-tutorial|home-manager]], we will see [an automatic and declarative way](https://github.com/juspay/nix-dev-home/commit/99f304a6512f59194932b2010af5e270efdfebe8) of doing this (through flake inputs).

You are not required to use a registry. Without a registry, getting a package off nixpkgs would instead involve its fully qualified [[flake-url|URL]]:

```text
$ nix run github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable#cowsay
...
```

{#external-software}
## Using software outside of [[nixpkgs]]

[[nixpkgs]] is not the only way to get software packaged by Nix. As you have seen immediately above, you can install programs from *any* [[flakes|flake]] by specifying its [[flake-url|flake URL]] to the `nix ?` commands. For example, [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/start/install) (which is used to build this very website) can be executed or installed directly off its flake [on GitHub](https://github.com/srid/emanote):

```text
$ nix run github:srid/emanote
...
```

You can of course also install it to your home directory:

```text
$ nix profile install github:srid/emanote
...
```
