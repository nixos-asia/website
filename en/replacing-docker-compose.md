# Replacing docker-compose with Nix for development

The reason to replace docker-compose with Nix is two fold. First, there is an [additional setup step](https://github.com/nammayatri/nammayatri/tree/f056bb994fbf9adefa454319032ca35c34ea65bc/Backend#other-tools) apart from running `nix develop`. Second, docker containers in macOS[^native-macos] are run on a VM, which can be a resource hog.

[^native-macos]: There is an [initiative to run containers natively on macOS](https://github.com/macOScontainers/homebrew-formula), but it is still in alpha and [requires a lot of additional steps](https://github.com/macOScontainers/homebrew-formula?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to setup. One such step is [disabling SIP](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection#3599244), which a lot of company monitored devices might not be allowed to do. ðŸ˜•

## NixOS services

Running services in NixOS is a breeze. For example, [running a PostgreSQL Database](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/PostgreSQL) is as simple as adding one line to your configuration:

```nix
{
  services.postgresql.enable = true;
}
```

This starts the database natively, without the need for a container.

## NixOS-like services

We need the same simplicity and also:

- Support for macOS and other Linux distributions
- Allow for running multiple instances of the same service (for use-case, see: [PostgreSQL in Nammayatri](#postgresql))
- Project-specific data directories (services data of two different projects are mutually exclusive)

To address the above points, we came up with [services-flake](https://community.flake.parts/services-flake).

>[!info] How are processes managed?
> In NixOS they are managed by [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd). In services-flake, we use [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose) whose configuration is managed by [process-compose-flake](https://community.flake.parts/process-compose-flake).

## Real-world example

Now that we have a way to run services natively, and also across platforms. It's time to replace [docker-compose services in Nammayatri (NY)](https://github.com/nammayatri/nammayatri/blob/f056bb994fbf9adefa454319032ca35c34ea65bc/Backend/nix/arion-configuration.nix) with services-flake. We will only look at a few services to keep it simple, for more details, see [PR](https://github.com/nammayatri/nammayatri/pull/3718).

### PostgreSQL

NY uses about 3 instances of postgresql databases.

One of them is [exported by passetto](https://github.com/nammayatri/passetto/blob/nixify/process-compose.nix) (passetto is a haskell application that encrypts data before storing in postgres), and using it looks like:

```nix
{
  services.passetto.enable = true;
}
```

By using [[modules|module system]], we can hide the implementation details and only expose the `passetto` service to the user, and use it as above.

The other two instances are used by the [postgres-with-replica module](https://github.com/nammayatri/nammayatri/blob/ccab8da607cfd8d4e9f7d28b55b83e22eec1af9b/Backend/nix/services/postgres-with-replica.nix). This module starts two services (`primary` and `replica` database) and a [pg-basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html) process (to sync `replica` with `primary` during init). For the user it is:

```nix
{
  services.postgres-with-replica.enable = true;
}
```

### Redis

Redis and its clustered version are pretty straightforward:

```nix
{
  services.redis.enable = true;
  services.redis-cluster.enable = true;
}
```

## Conclusion

By not depending on docker anymore, we can now run the entire NY backend with one command and its all defined in a [single place](https://github.com/nammayatri/nammayatri/blob/ccab8da607cfd8d4e9f7d28b55b83e22eec1af9b/Backend/nix/services/nammayatri.nix). 

That is not all, we can also reuse this to do much more, like defining [loadtest](https://github.com/nammayatri/nammayatri/blob/ccab8da607cfd8d4e9f7d28b55b83e22eec1af9b/Backend/load-test/default.nix) config and run it in CI/local, again, with one command.

Here's the screen grab of the devShell and the commands to run loadtest and the entire backend:
