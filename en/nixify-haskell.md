# Nixify Haskell projects

This is a #[[tutorial|tutorial]] series on nixifying #[[haskell]] projects. In part 1, we will begin with using nothing but [[nixpkgs]]. In the latter parts, we'll use simplifiy our project Nix code through [haskell-flake](https://community.flake.parts/haskell-flake) which builds on top of the Haskell infrastructure in [[nixpkgs]].[^other] 

1. [[nixify-haskell-nixpkgs]]#
2. [ ] Modularize our flake using [[flake-parts]]
3. [ ] Nixify Haskell projects with haskell-flake

[^other]: There are also other approaches (like [haskell.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix), [stacklock2nix](https://github.com/cdepillabout/stacklock2nix)).
