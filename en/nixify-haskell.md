# Nixify Haskell projects

This is a #[[tutorial|tutorial]] series on nixifying #[[haskell]] projects. In part 1, we will begin with using nothing but [[nixpkgs]]. In the latter parts, we'll use simplifiy our project Nix code through [haskell-flake] which builds on top of the Haskell infrastructure in [[nixpkgs]].[^other] 

1. [x] [[nixify-haskell-nixpkgs]]#
2. [ ] [[nixify-haskell-parts]]#
3. [ ] [[nixify-haskell-flake]]#

[^other]: There are also other approaches (like [haskell.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix), [stacklock2nix](https://github.com/cdepillabout/stacklock2nix)).
