:::

[Sridhar Ratnakumar][srid] will demonstrate the delights of using [[nix|Nix]] to [[dev|develop]] [[rust|Rust]] as well as [[haskell|Haskell]] projects without needing to do any manual global setup on your system. We'll start from a pristine [[macos|macOS]] machine as well as a pristine Linux machine to get our [[dev|development environment]] up and running in no time, all the way up to [LSP] support in VSCode
