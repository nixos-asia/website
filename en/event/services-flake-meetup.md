:::

[Shivaraj B H][shivaraj-bh] will demonstrate using [[services-flake]] to declaratively manage service dependencies (for example, databases) of your project in the [[nix|Nix]] development environment and re-use the same configuration for testing in your CI workflow. This talk builds upon [my lightning talk from NixCon 2024][nixcon-talk], diving deeper into the topic with additional insights.

The talk serves as a video demonstration of the **Part-4** in the [[nixify-haskell]] series.
